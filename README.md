# Deep Learning Guitar Amplifier

This is a real-time implementation of a CNN which was trained to emulate a guitar amplifier. The plugin was created using JUCE and outperformed similar implementations (at the time at least, not sure anymore). This was part of my thesis project for my MS in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University.

It has been a long time since I looked at this project, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions about it!
